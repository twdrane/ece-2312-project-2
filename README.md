# ECE 2312 project 2

The objective of this course project is to explore how to artificially generated sounds 
using sinusoidal functions such as sin(x) and cos(x), how to include these sounds with 
other sound files, and how to remove these sounds using simple filtering techniques. 
This project will be built on top of the previous project.
